## Logseq Reference Styles

Logseq Reference Styles is a new plugin to make Logseq beautiful.

It lets you configure emoji and colors for block references that match patterns of your choice.

To open the config screen, open the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P on MacOS, Ctrl-Shift-P on Windows), and search for "Modify block reference styles". To add new rows, use the "Add" button in the lower left, and to remove rows, hover the mouse over the row and click the "X" on the right of the row. Changes save automatically, and to close the window, click the "X" in the upper left, press "Esc", or click in the darkened area around the window.
